Data- Employee Sample Data Data shape- 1001R X 15C 
Advanced Excel shortcut keys have been used to clean and format the dataset.

*Format the Data set CNTRL+T 
*Applied the filter CNTRL+SHIFT+L 
*Manually checked the null values. 
*Inspect the Duplicate Values ALT+A+M 
*Applied conditional formatting on BONUS attribute CNTRL+Q ( mark the bonus which is above 20%) *Insert a column on the left side of BONUS as a PROMOTION attribute to know who got promoted. CNTRL+SHIFT+PLUS sign key. 
*Used Logical function in Promotion attribute. =if(Bonus>20%,"Promoted",if(and(bonus>=20%, bonus<20%),"Promoted", "Not Promoted") * Changed the Date Format CNTRL+SHIFT+#
